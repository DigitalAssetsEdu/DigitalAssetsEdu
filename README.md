Hi, I’m @DigitalAssetsEdu
Welcome to the Digital Assets Education GitHub Repository! This repository is dedicated to projects and resources related to Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and Cybersecurity. Here, you will find a variety of coding projects and educational materials aimed at enhancing your understanding and capabilities in Enterprise Risk Management and GRC.

I’m currently learning how to write code for Enterprise Risk Management using Python (Spyder) at the University of Connecticut

I’m looking to collaborate on App Development for GRC Education
